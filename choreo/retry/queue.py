    The DeadLetterQueue holds messages that originally came from other queues.
    It is similar to the FailedQueue. Functionally the difference is that
    DeadLetterQueue.quarantine() moves a message from a source queue whereas
    FailedQueue.quarantine() adds a message to the failed queue.

    The DeadLetterQueue can be used by retry logic: after retying a job
    some number of times the job can be moved from the FailedQueue to the
    DeadLetterQueue. (This could potentially be extended to multiple levels
    of dead letter queues.
